# Vyona

> _Where magic flows through code._

Vyona is an interactive, magic-themed web experience that blends **ethereal aesthetics**, **smooth UI motion**, and **modern web design** to immerse users in a world where **code feels like spellcraft**.

Inspired by **https://bylunar.dev** by @Mohit Tiwari, this project reimagines a personal/creative web portal through the lens of **mysticism, light, and energy** — everything from the visuals to the interactions is powered by the idea that the web can feel magical again.

- **Dark Aura Mode:** Default dark mode with deep indigo-to-violet gradients and faint motion lighting.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Works perfectly on all screen sizes — crafted with Tailwind CSS.  
- **Optimized Build:** Blazing-fast setup using **Vite + React**.

## Setup

Clone and run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swamstick911/vyona.git
cd vyona
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start on http://localhost:5173

## Design Philosophy

Vyona draws from:

- Fantasy magic systems (aether, mana, and light energy)

- Futuristic minimalism (neon glow, glassmorphism, gentle parallax)

- Interactive storytelling — each animation feels like casting a spell.

- The color palette flows from deep indigo (#1a0033) → violet (#6a00ff) → cyan glow (#00fff0).

## Future Plans

- Spell Nodes: Interactive “magic circle” UI where users trigger animations.

- Lore Mode: Hidden story snippets appear after certain interactions.

- Arcane Console: A command-line style “spell terminal” for dev magic commands.

- Ambient Audio Layer: Faint mystical background music that reacts to movement.
