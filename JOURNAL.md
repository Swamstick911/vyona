worked for 1 hour 3 minutes 

Made the `Landing.jsx` file for a landing page for Vyona. It looks like this for now.

This page isn't fully completed yet as I am thinking to add more things here

**Animations:**

- The title "Vyona" has a floating animation
- The button at the bottom has an animation on hover
- The orb on the right also has animation
- There are particles twinkling at the back for ambience

Updates 
- Made it have a custom cursor.
